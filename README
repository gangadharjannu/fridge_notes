Yet another learning project. 

--Javascript
---- jQuery
---- JSON (storing small amounts of data in the URL)
-- CSS
---- Learning some cool effects!    

Started out as a fun note-maker for my girlfriend.  I found a tutorial that helped me pimp out the graphics:

Currently, notes will shuffle around every time you refresh.  I kind of like it that way.
